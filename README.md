# conway_cann

cellular automatic neural network that learns the classic conway's ruleset


### TODO

- speed the damned thing up. frames are so slow.
- make another reference ring
- make each ring separately grabbable and scalable
- add a floor
- make a neural net ring (whee math!)
- make the neural net ring trainable (whee math!)
- train ring on touch while grabbing
    - intersection distance determines learning rate
