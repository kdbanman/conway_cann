### TODO

- allow row and column +/- to each environment
- allow save environment to png through Texture2D or with BinaryFormatter
    - http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/860734/best-method-to-save-a-multi-dimensional-array-as-a.html
- only advance the ring being held.
- add weight inspector panels
- add cost panel frame around the graph panel
- make another reference ring with different rules
- render rings with meshes and texture mapping
- make rings loadable by choosing pattern and rules from list
