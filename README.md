# conway_cann

cellular automatic neural network that learns the classic conway's ruleset


### TODO

- make the neural net ring trainable (whee math!)
- train ring on touch while grabbing
    - this ontriggerstay intersection stuff seems really slow with no training at all yet
        - probably optimize the dumb shit away (GetComponent?)
        - probably thread the training
    - intersection distance determines learning rate
- speed the damned thing up. frames are so slow.
- make another reference ring
- add a floor
